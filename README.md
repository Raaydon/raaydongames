DISCLAIMER: FLASH GAMES ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED ON CHROME AND MANY OTHER BROWSERS SO ONLY GAMES UNDER THE HTML5 CATEGORY WILL WORK
(If you can get flash working then the flash games will work though)

It is important to note that all of these games are the property of their respective creators.
If you want a game removed please contact me.

Just click on a game and play it, you may need to enable flash by pressing allow.
